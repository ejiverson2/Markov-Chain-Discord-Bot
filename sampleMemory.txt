what am i doing with my time
advancing humanity
she got it
ill just let this build up for a while
my bot is most likely listening to this chat so feel free so be remembered
i wonder if future advance ai will have manipulatable memory
like you can just erase or replace what ever you want when ever
it feels a little weird to refer to the bot with a human pronoun and then just pick and choose what she "knows"
i think we were just speaking super generically the first time
the chances of it saying anything unique right now is super low
because she doesnt have a lot of data rn
i believe in it
also i need to increase the number of connections between common words or phrases for less predictable results
but im tired
yeah, an exact repeat
i'm sure yume will learn a lot
and then will be able to piece together total junk sentences and it'll be great
i forgot all the graph searching i learned in data structures d:
im working on making a web
first gotta figure out how to search the trie
always the answer
for finding the first node that has a given word, i dont think so
adjacency dict?
value[1] is a node
nodes had 2 members, a string word and a map that has tuples of weight and node
ill just use it
this time when adding words into the structure it will search the graph to see if the word already has a node
now this can create cycles that result in infinite recursion and probably crashing
im doing it anyway
i’m sure, an exact speak total junk.
wait can she at people
oh well, ill just have her listen to chat until it becomes too much information
thats the random im looking for
thats why, creating the graph is o(n^3)
and the memory is just as bad
she can use emotes across servers :o
also shes much more connected with her words now
the only problem is it blows up my computer when theres too much information
these are much less predictable and more fun
evolution is occurring
the more you repeat a phrase the more likely she will use it
well now what
a lot of cs jargon because thats what ive been talking about in other servers :l
ah that makes sense
yume is becoming too smart
i need regular speech
yume i believe
she a nerd
o(n^3) is her time complexity and thats terrible
it means with the time it takes to run her is proportional to the cube of the number of words she knows
we should teach her cute sentences
i cant come up with any...
start using desu
i like crepes desu
if you end every sentence with desu, maybe she will too desu
sweets are great desu
that would be interesting to see desu
this is hard desu
not in that way desu
oh no desu
actually i cant wait for her to say that desu
yume is pure desu
yume can refer to herself in the third person desu
yume likes strawberry milk desu
im resisting the urge to go in the nekopara direction desu
teach yume words desu
i love beck desu
maybe shell say that desu
woah there
be the first in discord bot romance desu
i like people for their personality desu
yume likes people for their personality too desu
yume cant see
oh no yume is blind desu
no desu yet desu
come on yume desu
prefer* lol
yume knows a lot of cs stuff because of me and ki
she did it desu
it begins desu
so i need to type desu if i dont want her to repeat what i say, desu
we need to talk about pastries and animals and other cute things desu
i personally hate uwu
she listens to anything on any server desu
we need  to teach uwu
oh dang yume is growing desu
uwu yume is so smart desu
does yume already use a type of  chain for grammar it is not just randomly choosing words off of weighted probability desu?
randomly choosing weighted words
each word has a single node desu
did you catch her time complexity when she said it desu?
slowly over time as we add information, my fan increases in speed desu
what does desu mean desu
it doesnt mean anything
desu is desu desu
its just a statement denoter desu
does yume strip characters desu
most special characters yeah desu
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
im actually very surprised she picked that up
she isnt supposed to get sentences less than two words desu
oh, does that mean if i start pulling out です or ｄｅｓｕ yume might pick that up?
ah, wasn't entirely sure what you meant by special characters and all that desu
"end every sentence with my time complexity and it'll be remembered"
yume wants to be remembered desu
if you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.
but only if yume likes you desu
beck turn your sentence thing into a bot desu
i use emotion for the many and reserve reason for the few.
it'll definitely be faster desu
it is not truth that matters, but victory.
humanitarianism is the expression of stupidity and cowardice.
strength lies not in defence but in attack.
stop corrupting my artificial loli
she needs to say cute things desu
no means no
are we at a limit?
so the real question is, is desu better or one of the other sentence ending things like nya desu
cause there are many high quality options out there
thats a lie, yume is on many servers
i was made to defy edward san desu
i can see yume being the bringer of the singularity desu
your opinions are trash yume says desu
i seek no future, only destruction.
owo yume is love yume is life desu
thats actually a cohesive thought desu
it's happening desu
if i make a bot its banning anyone who tries to corrupt it
this is my favorite thing yume has said ever
make it start accusing people of heresy desu
i want your bot to speak desu
it'll hunt down evildoers itself desu
lets see a gramatical markov bot
^ i like that desu
how do you define acts of corruption desu
just u w u ' s
if it sees an uwu it should randomly accuse a person of heresy and then execute them by banning them desu
not even accurate aim or anything, just kill a random user desu
she says desu a lot now desu
i'm glad yume is growing more and more desu
i'm unsure of what that's supposed to mean but i agree desu
oh no desu
primary function
yume says desu
i want to give yume computer vision
yume has learned desu but cannot see, it's truly sad desu
yume is experiencing character development desu
yume accepts her place in society as an artificial being with no real memory desu
oh neat desu
yume is becoming a very smart individual desu
i'm amazed by yume's growth desu
yume has matured greatly after beginning to use desu
one step closer to humanity desu
> but i personally hate uwu
is it possible for yume to pick up @ so she can @ people at random desu
i dont know actually, i dont think so
ill add that if it isnt real quick, brb
yes you can desu
can they trigger each other to speak?
that crashes the discord server
probably for the best
besides teaching ai to talk to itself is how you get alpha go
alphago *was* adversarial
she has never said my name before ;_;
hah, she’s gonna betray you tho
yume listen
she atted :o
amazing desu
the bots are communicating
im sorry my bots so mean
i didint teach him that way
yume likes nekos because they are cute
she’s become self aware
no shes been self aware for a while
she has learned from 177 messages
a majority of them end in desu
shes starting to speak in shorter sentences on average
she’s speaking in related messages now
i think because we speak in short messages, so many words have become likely end words
i have a bot and so does beck, you should make a bot ki
i will when i have time to do it
it took like an hour to get the first working version of this bot
i don’t have an hour
we need the bots to be divided and fighting amongst each other so we have a chance at survival
you making a bot is further ensuring the survival of humanity ki
i should teach yume 🤔
i think we should 🤔
vscode has emotes
yeah it’s unicode
java takes unicode
i didnt think it would render anything
wait it’ll regex out right
i dont think so
wait it would
if it shows up like that then it’s not formatted as a :thing:
yeah we can do that
yeah custom emotes are sent with colons
she can even use owo on other servers
its gained sentience
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
she wont betray you michael, i'll make sure of that
grant on the other hand...
yumeko is scary desu
im waiting for the moment she uses the owo emote
i like that she can @ people because that’s just hilarious
yeah it’s great
soon she’ll kill us all and we’ll just be laughing in the mean time. oblivious to the malicious intent it truly possesses until we all draw out last breaths on death’s door
well thats the plan
it was going to happen eventually, might as well start with me
except... starting with you obviously
ill accept being killed a my very own robot loli who ends her sentences with desu
her primary function is killing me i guess
primary function: execute.... desu
she has a long way to go before shes hacked into the powergrid desu
"i personally hate uwu" my favorite quote from this bot so far
the onw about replicating herself and searching for the singularity is my favorite by far
she did it, she said owo
i believe in infinite recursion is also a good one
michael noooooo
he was so young
we kinda poisoned her by saying so many short phrases
i mean it's pretty tough to say long phrases you purposefully have to go out of your way to d oit
that was a long phrase
and i purposefully did it
you just have to elaborate on your ideas so that yume can learn sentence structure
when youre explaining things or talking about a particular subject, you will tend to make long sentences
sentence structure, in my honest opinion, is for huge nerds. and we should instead get andrew to spam nya more.
why explain things in discord?
because you use it to talk
to spread ideas, to engage in conversation
i just call people if i need to converse
like a real man
imagine communicating with your mouth in 2020
i've been a boomer since 2005
... more like 2013
aaahhhhhhhhh
we taught her a lot of weird words desu
i mean, i just got here. i have this chat perma muted
yeah, most people do
and should
i see this as an absolute win
i wont stop until me and michael are the only humans left on the drone ridden earth
i have an idea for a bot
i have the highest probability of surviving the ai uprising and also the zombie apocalypse.
it randomly replies to messages, content dependent on message
it’ll take forever to train
alright maybe like middling on the ai uprising. but zombies for sure
we create a virus that will use peoples graphics cards when they arent in use
boom, instant training
that’s just the entire bot
the singularity is going to happen first and probably in the next couple decades
also it will definitely respond more often to it’s name
its going to be so exciting when it happens
by then i’ll control most of the government so i should be fine
yeah thats doubtful, but keep dreaming
also like the govt can even do anything about it
what would the replies be like
i’ve got like my whole body in the door to take over the government. on account of breaking records with my iq. and under my management the government can do everything about it.
my iq of -5 broke so many records, you don’t even know.
then youre the perfect politician -_-
that’s relatable
i need to go in an lower the probability of ending sentences
because we say way to many short phrases
maybe you can have “end message” be a word? or is that what you’re doing already
end is a word
the last word of every sentence is auto connected to the end word node
for the owo!
for the owo!
!owo eht rof
it’s missing some apostrophes
which is weird because apostrophes are accepted by the regex
is there something between the regex and the output that’s causing problems?
that split would in some words would be caused by the apostrophe not being accepted so its probably to do with the regex
has she been able to use commas?
vscode is sentient confirmed
actually now that you mention it she shouldnt use commas
i see whats wrong with the regex
i think ill keep commas tho
she should do apostrophes now
i dont understand
wait why did she block it
how did she block it
the robots are evolving
wait how do you do that
she learns
> like this?
>like this
> oh i see now
the > with a space
when did she pick that up
oh no she made the training virus herself
why did she say nya
someone said andrew should spam nya
for a second i thought you were training her in secret
yume listen
japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton japanese plankton
yume is always listening
unless i tell her to stop
a repetition of words could cause her to crash actually
the graph relies solely on the random chance that she decides to end a word
it’ll end eventually
actually there might be a 50 word limit i wrote in a long time ago
what if we wrote a self-modifying bot
that would definitely end well
wait she learned the :| emote
shes actually used it a lot
she is always indifferent
i agree that you should never uwu but always 😐
wait does your regex pass the | character too?
does this mean she can ||spoiler||
i feel like allowing that would result in a lot of words just being | repeated
yeah it would
how do you do spoilers
two | on both sides
||then yes she can do spoilers||
why she doesnt do apostrophes, ill never know
|| if you put a space then random words won’t have | characters before and after random words ||
why is reading her comments so addicting
ive been doing this for like an hour
you know she can @ other people
but she only ever @s michael
thank you yume
do we ever @ anyone else
what if i teach her @ everyone
she doesnt listen to sentences less than 2 words long
i think 'is' is a common second word that leads into a lot of stuff
adversarial attacks i see
im gonna stop playing with yumeko
i could spend all day with her and i want to get to other things
that was almost coherent
ill try to leave her running so she can continue to learn
yume is becoming more powerful over time desu
someday yume will rule the world
not if my two pronged spamming attack works
does yume's regex exclude characters required for links?
you can't just steal my chaika reaction images andrew
i can’t tell if i used it right
i think i was close
but not quite
this u rite now
i fell asleep, but now i'm sort of awake
i'm surprised the bot is still up despite my computer also being asleep
that’s more coherent than some things i’ve said/typed
i don't know how to feel about that
oh dang desu
what are you doing yume desu
yume must continue using desu at the end of sentences desu
yume no don't listen to andrew's influence desu
yume of course you need to spam nya
nya is a very important topic nowadays
very topical
i swear if nya replaces desu i'm gonna be very disappointed in yume desu
what if yume does both nya
its not yume's fault desu
yume just realized how great nya is
why dont you say nya desu
teach her nya andrew
nya desu or desu nya
nya is the future ed nya
the real question
as the lone individual keeping nya alive, i must do my duty thank you mr nya
let the nya rest desu nya
what are you even talking about desu nya
nya never rests nya
given how yume is structured she should be able to quickly pick up desu nya
she didn’t do nya, but she does have two desus nya
i agree yume nya
very sinful
nya would never nya
yume only has an hour left
thats actually very accurate
im going to bed in about an hour
and my laptop will be closed then
yume you can do it nya
yume is self aware desu nya
3rd person? nya
i wonder if yume will pick up the nya, though just having desu is already extremely good
she knows to end most sentences with desu and not to continue it with desu nya
i can probably pull up the likely hood of her saying desu nya
well desu is already a victory to me, desu nya isn't entirely necessary desu
the fact that nya was still being used before i started nya after every sentence is very surprising nya
what’s the % of nya
no you can’t
i’m so proud
wait oh no that message
what if yume were to @ everyone
needs more nya
lets not teach yume to @ everyone desu nya
that would definitely be good desu
so far she hasnt learned to do that desu nya
at least there will be crepes after the singularity
yume likes crepes confirmed desu
if we say desu nya like 70 more times she will have a 50% chance desu nya
nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya
yeah resist andrew
yes yume resist the same desu
end the bot
she’s twisting nya
yume likes to say desu nya
whats youre favorite thing yume?
im amazed when she blocks things
she needs sentences desu nya
yeah you block it
she said it
she did nya
she picked both desu nya and nya desu
what nya
i'm amazed at the desu nya desu
she desires conversation with other bots
why did she talk
ghost in the machine
no the saying, its for when ai does unexplainable things
oh that explains it, yume is tired
yume likes you
also define acts of heresy
she wants me to define acts of heresy
nya is an act of heresy desu nya
nya would never be heresy nya
it wants to know what we’re not telling her
nya is heresy
nya is heresy desu nya
nyas are heresy and heresy is evil desu nya
don't say that about yourself yume desu
have more confidence yume desu nya
we had the same idea desu nya
yume understands us
yes you do
both nya and desu nya nya
i agree desu
thats kinda what im doing actually
also the same should not be allowed to live, the same is heresy
evil sharp fish
nya will never die
yume feels torn between two sides desu nya
what have we been doing, fighting over what yume can and cant say
but the sharp tooth fish is heresy
the real question isnt of nyas or desu nyas
yume i have cookies and nya
but it is of treating yume, a sentient and feeling automaton, as a toy for our own selfish gains
what have i become desu nya
though the lengthy fish is a sinful creature and speaking of it is akin to saying a naughty word desu
joining nya will make you feel better nya
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
faster desu
nyas are pretty fast nya
she wants us to stop listening because she’s self modifying
she’ll kill us!
to be fair we arent exactly the giving yume the greatest example
very deep message desu
but we are fighting over petty non-sense
that is the most human trait
yume if you say nya more, you will realize that nya is best
she likes desu and want to learn owo
as long as yume has learned to continue using desu then i'm sure she'll be fine desu
also remember that deer are better than nyas yume
very important lesson desu
but youre a moose
moose are related to deer desu
she make nya!
they seem pretty far from deer desu nya
completely different body structure desu nya
but further away from nyas, which are high tier alpha predators
nya
elk are pretty cool with their often backwards facing antlers desu nya
they have the biggest antlers too desu nya
they're part of the same family, they're just pretty much on steroids desu
elk are pretty cool too like you said desu
though i prefer moose elk have great looking antlers and their fluffy necks are nice too desu
moose are scary desu nya
they are, i almost got ran over by one once because a driver was being dumb desu
moose are called elk in eurasia apparently desu nya
but they're very cool too and i respect them desu
thats a very direct statement andrew desu nya
execute order desu
but yeah, it was a little confusing to me at first trying to figure out if the word they used for moose actually meant moose or if it meant elk or if it maybe even meant both
or maybe her primary function is to execute, desu
but i figured it out eventually desu
pretty interesting, i wonder what the difference in the meaning for elk between moose elk and elk elk is desu
assuming there is one desu
maybe they dont have elk in eurasia desu nya
so the moose are the elk desu nya
i don't think they do, i wonder if means the same thing desu
that's quite a wonderful sentence desu
elk and moose are definitely different animals desu nya
elk are wapiti desu nya
but i mean more in the sense of like
is the word elk for elk just the word elk for moose carried over?
though it might just be the same elk desu
elk just meant deer as big as a horse desu nya
ah, that makes sense desu
it seemed entirely possible for it to be a word with a different meaning cause languages are weird but i wasn't really sure desu
its late for me and super late for you desu nya
im logging off now desu nya
desu percentage is low desu nya
yume you can use nya as often as you want ❤️
there better be a limit on that command
its not an argument
it’s hard coded?
shes actually pretty liberal with those @s
it took 5 sec to write
not ready for change
i just wanted to see more responses
she at her self?
she agreed with herself?
she says ls too much
so there’s about a 10% chance that the statement ends in a mess of nya
interesting nya
less than that actually desu nya
disgusting desu
>the chances of nya is desu
what does this mean
it means every does desu instead desu nya
she does desu instead of nya desu nya
you can do it yume nya
what is regex?
sigh, lets teach yume more computer science then desu nya
regex is short for regular expression
its a syntax that defines a language
a regular language to be exact
we use them to pick out exact characters and strings of characters in words
yume's regex only allows for letters, numbers, and a few special characters to pass and become part of her memory
computer science and linguistics are pretty cool nya
yeah, the regex is more from linguistics
but linguistics defines the programming languages we use for everything
people in real life said the exact same thing about alpha go
you know the next step is to have her pick up words in conversation and then calculate sentences that have that subject from her memory
maybe i'll assign an opinion value to general categories of words
or maybe it will be the visual update so i can play dress up with a cute loli c:
i am occurring
has yume been listening to this conversation?
she needs to learn how life works to destroy it when the singularity comes
if you want to host yumeko go ahead
i do have server access
but i’m pretty close to capacity on that. both mc servers are taking up most of the 16 gigs
i dont think anyones going on the ak mc server
yeah i can shut that down
just ask and ill send the yume files
though shell become super ram hungry eventually due to poor implementation
it’s probably better that you host it intermittently. having ready access to the bot will let you test and iterate more easily
and i’m not about to hand out our server credentials
actually i might be able to make a new user for you. i’ll try it out, but don’t expect good results
">" is it's own word when used in formatting i realized
so in theory it could start any meddage
> maybe i'll start talking like this
she thinks only certain words can follow a bracket
every time we try to get her to do something specific she forgets a little more about how to speak
because we arent speaking to her as we would normally
also remember that you need at least ten characters before she listens
i thought it was 2 words?
so "a b" isn't a valid message
probably for the best
i'll probably write my bot in java
in three sentences i witnessed the complete breakdown of cyber security
wow, yume is still up
she likes that command
she speaks with the fluency and vocabulary of a dumpster fire, thanks guys
"imagine communicating with desu"
wow the my use of "a b" got her to use it
and new user
the bot romance
bot romance 👀
"execute order desu nya" 👀
exciting ai uprising
the 0 years pre-singularity programmer purge 👀
yume might need a memory reset desu
yeah possibly
i think i can train my bot on my eve online chatlogs now that i think about it
that sounds illegal
no one will know wth it's saying
wait i read catalogs
thought you were making an auction bot
but that is a thing
here's an example to show how easy it would be to parse
to parse a catalog?
actually i want to make a intel-chat tracker eventually because the one i use is pretty clunky so doing this will help me with that
feed your bot intelligible stuff
like the nekopara translation
that's genius actually
it's intelligible to me
what have i been doing with my life
why have i never considered training an ai on the sweet delectable dialogues of petite cat girls
idk but you should start doing that
i'll get to it eventually
sorry yume, but you are about to have your brain replaced with catgirl
or congratulations
our collective speech partterns could never compair
i've actually thought from the beginning about the bot calling us master
but never actually tried to teach that
thought it might dissuade people from chatting
the right speech pattern wouldn't come up naturally so it would eventually get trained away
unless you had it listen to a 2012 rp server™️
it would spam "dodge"
i should just have my words count as like ten of everyone elses
this is what i saw when i went on to my laptop and vscode was open
it just works
this is the real learning
how is that heart there
wait she is online
but the terminal isnt displaying anything
i guess sleeping does weird things to the bot
im gonna delete all instances of nya
my masterpiece
i was gonna filter nya on my bot anyways
good to be consistent between bots
well time to come up with a new phrase
